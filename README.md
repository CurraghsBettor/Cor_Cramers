This function was programmed to estimate, biased Cramer’s V, biased Tschuprow’s T, and their unbiased counterparts. Confidence intervals of those estimates are obtained using a fisher z-transformation (see T. Yano, 2015; https://rpubs.com/estopub/114408). To illustrate how to use this function I took back results from Baharloo and colleagues. (1998). These authors assessed the proportion of absolute pitch possessors among musicians as a function of their onset in musical training. They concluded that a clear correlation between early musical training and the prevalence of AP possessors exists. The strength of this correlation is tested more precisely using the above-mentioned effect sizes.
